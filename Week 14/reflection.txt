Please take a few minutes to reflect on your experience in CSE 111 and
think about the challenges, successes, and all that you've learned
along the way.


Now, please respond thoroughly (1 - 2 paragraphs for each question) to
the following questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.
My experience I had was when we were in class 
and my teacher was showing us how to write a program with many functions,
working to accomplish the main goal. I was able to see how functions were effective.
I saw how they make programs more effective. You able to put a certain code that,
does something and place it in the big picture.


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
I think the value in test functions is that you are able to be more certain
that you code works properly. It won't do everything but it does help in making
your programs run more properly and work. They can help as an extra back up the 
program you are trying to accomplish. I think test functions are super important 
to use in programming.


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?
One thing I do is using test functions can help in figuring out what the fix needs 
to be. The main thing is using the debugging tool to see how your program is working. 
To find the solution in figuring out what is wrong. One thing I feel I can work on is using
the debugging tool more often. Making it a  go to in fixing issue in your program and 
also using test functions more often. Also being more familar with test functions.
