Significant Program Proposal

(This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best knowledge
at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the beginning to the
end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and some of the ideas we
proposed change. This is part of completing any project and is fine.
However, we still must write a proposal so that our teachers or
supervisors know what we intend to do. Please answer each of the
following questions to the best of your knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?
weather_data

2. What real world problem will your program address or help to solve?
It will display charts and help visulize data sets using pandas

3. What will you learn from developing this program?
I will gain a greater understanding of how to use pandas and organize data in a visual way for users. 
To better understand panadas and learn more about python and to undersatnd python more.

4. What Python modules will your program use? (Some examples are: csv,
datetime, functools, matplotlib, math, pandas, pytest, random, requests,
and tkinter.)
It will use Pandas and csv and pytest for testing the program.

5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?
Yes, they will be seperated into functions that will perform seperate tasks.

6. Will you write test functions to test many of your program functions?
Yes I will try my best to add test functions to my program I am making.
